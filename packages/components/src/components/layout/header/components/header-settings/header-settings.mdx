HeaderSettings is wrapper around HeaderDropdown to allow passing it to Header as direct children and automatically position
it. That allows to pass custom content to settings dropdown. <br />
HeaderSettings also automatically adds logout or login buttons to header. <br />
When headerType from Layout properties is set to **'public'**, HeaderSettings renders only login button. <br /> When headerType
from Layout properties is set to **'system'**, HeaderSettings renders logout button after children, if no children presents
renders only logout button.
<br />
**Note**: This component is not meant to be used outside of Header.
